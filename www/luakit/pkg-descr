Luakit is a highly configurable, micro-browser framework
based on the WebKit web content engine and the GTK+ toolkit.

It is very fast, extensible by Lua and licensed under the
GNU GPLv3 license. It is primarily targeted at power users,
developers and any people with too much time on their hands
who want to have fine-grained control over their web browsers
behaviour and interface.

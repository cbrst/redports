herbstluftwm is a manual tiling window manager for X11 using Xlib and
Glib. Its main features can be described with:

- the layout is based on splitting frames into subframes which can be
  split again or can be filled with windows (similar to i3/ musca)

- tags (or workspaces or virtual desktops or â€¦) can be added/removed at
  runtime. Each tag contains an own layout

- exactly one tag is viewed on each monitor. The tags are monitor
  independent (similar to xmonad)

- it is configured at runtime via ipc calls from herbstclient. So the
  configuration file is just a script which is run on startup. (similar to
  wmii/ musca)
